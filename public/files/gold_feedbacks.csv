301,"I like the pitch. Seems like a really neat idea!

A few comments:
- I'd love a more concrete understanding of the problem and solution. I get that $15b is spent on fuel but is the problem weight? inefficiency? Cost? Something else? I'd also love a concrete example. Like ""rocket X spent $Y on propulsion and struggled because of the weight. If they used our fuel, they would have spent .1Y and been 30% lighter and would have gotten ROI ___""
- It's hard to pitch ""hard science"" startups, but you did a pretty good job. One thing I'd consider is to go up one level of detail so that you're not talking about Newton-seconds or things like that =). Assume that most of the demo day audience will be smart laypeople: successful folks with backgrounds in marketing or sales or sometimes engineers. They are smart but don't often have an engineering or physics background
- I'd skip the Black Box slide. It's TMI in my opinion.
- Sometimes the content was orthogonal to the slides. The slide would have a few bullet points but you focused on one or kind of talked about a tangent. I would try to really tie the content to the slides. If you aren't going to talk about something, considering removing it from the deck; on the other hand, if you're going to talk about something, consider putting it onto a slide.
- I've heard of SpaceX (obviously) so your background seems great for this. For the other 2 founders, I suspect ""positron physicists"" are rare, but I don't know how rare. If you can quantify that, like ""these are 2 of the top 5 positron physicists in the world"", that would make the team pitch even stronger",false,Leo,Polovets,leo@susaventures.com,Susa Ventures,7,Positron Dynamics,Other

And then make sure you communicate it clearly to customers, to your employees, to investors. Make it easy for them to understand. Yes your technology can do many things, but people are not searching necessarily for ""NLP to solve customer experience"". Right?

- Give a sense of customer size. If you're talking to 10 companies and they all sign up, would that be $100k in revenue total? $1m? $50m?
- I thought ""100x the internet"" was a hard to understand metric. 100x in terms of gigabytes? number of users? number of machines? something else?
- I'd love to understand a few use cases and also whether this has been done before. Not high level like ""oil and gas"", but maybe one concrete use cases that someone has done. Something like ""proctor and gamble used this approach to design chemical X that does Y and saved them $Z money. however only companies of proctor and gamble's size have these simulation tools, and we are democratizing that""

- I think you spent way too much time on analogy of yellow pages vs adwords, but the analogy didn't ad much to the pitch.

- reorder the product slides so that you talk about the chip, then the server, then the cloud, building up from one stage to the next
- don't talk too much about very low level details because most people won't understand that. For example, when you talk about the chip, don't talk too much about temperature differentials or physics principles; just say something like ""there are three main components that people have worked on, but the hard part is combining them on one chip. We are teh first to have done that and we have patentable IP for each of the components and at the chip level""
- you talk pretty fast, which doesn't give audience much of a chance to process what you say. It's better to say less and say it a little more slowly.
- I think it could be useful to mention why someone would use QC instead of AWS or GPUs or etc. You mentioned great use cases, but why would someone want to do big data on top of QC? I think it's because it might be many orders of magnitude faster, but I'm not sure.
- I'd definitely mention that you're part of YC. That's a very strong signal.
- Too much detail on team slide. Give 3-5 bullet points about the team instead of 2-3 bullet points for each of 5 people
- the slide with some device with thermal coloring didn't make much sense to me -- and I'm an engineer =)

Questions
- Seems like a slow growth business ($50K revenue - cumulative - by end of 2014). How do you accelerate growth?
- How will the retailers’ customers find out about the mobile store fronts? What would trigger the consumers to look for them? Will there be sufficient traffic and transactions to turn this into a big business?
- What’s the competitive landscape and how are you different/better?
- Mentioned apparel and gifts as target segments, but used last-minute shopping for wine as opening example… is there really a compelling use case in apparel and gifts? Is this a nice-to-have or must-have for consumers?

49,"- I really liked the story at the beginning, although I thought there were a few places where you could've taken out details. For example, when discussing the journal article, instead of talking about the chemical name, the disease it caused, etc, you could've said something like ""what the insurance company didn't realize was that 7 years earlier, a journal article had been published which found that one of the ingredients was toxic.""
- I'd love more numbers about the size of the opportunity. For example, in your intro story, you could mention that the company lost $40m for that insurance policy, the industry as a whole lost $2b, and that's just for one product.
- Slide deck has too much text. Think more about 2-5 word blurbs rather than sentences and paragraphs
- I'd put the team slide toward end. You can tell the following story: ""here's a typical problem with product insurance.. here's our solution .. here's why we have the right experience to do this well""

Questions
- Venture-scale business? At 1% to make $1M you’d need $100M of transactions. Custom part orders tend to be small, so you need lots of them. And the revenue isn’t recurring. This all translates to downstream financing risk…
- What’s the long-term roadmap for turning this into a more lucrative business?
- What’s your secret sauce behind the recommendation/matching algorithm? How do you know it’d work at scale?
- To bootstrap the marketplace, which side do you focus on first - supply or demand? Different marketplaces have different dynamics… need to think this through.
- Need to find out what it’d take to attract series A, then work backwards to figure out what you need to accomplish and how much $ & time you need
",false,Alan,Chiu,achiu@xseedcap.com,XSeed Capital,1,,
41,"- It's not immediately clear whose problem your solving. Is this about maximizing ISP revenue? Helping users get internet access? Who is your customer?
- I'd reframe unit economics as per year instead of per day. $.01 per day feels like a razor thin margin that feels little room for error. On the other hand, if you say ""Bandwidth costs us $10/year/user and we can make $15-$30/year/user on ads"" that looks a lot more attractive.
- Any numbers you can share about your early pilots would be great validation -- especially on the user economics side
- Another thing that could be worth mentioning (assuming it's true), is that data might cost you $10/user/year now, but that drops over time while you can still make the same amount of money on ads. Maybe next year data will only be $6/user/year, which greatly improves your unit economics

38,"Great to meet and hear the story.
A suggestion in the pitch - keep in mind that at a demo day pitch you with be in an audience of all types, many of which will not be experts within your industry.  Keep the presentation simple and clear.

37,"- try to tighten up the pitch a little bit. You went to 9 minutes instead of 6, and while all of the content was good, I think you could've trimmed a few minutes off. For example, on the slide about Rick, you can describe his tools in one sentence each instead of 3-4 sentences each (e.g. ""Rick needs to track customers in his CRM, juggle his calendar, map his appointments, and do analyses... all while being on the road 80% of the day."")
- I wouldn't show the 562 sq foot apartment. It was funny,  but I felt like it took away from what you've accomplished
- Another example for being more succinct is the customer quote section: I'd put three up but maybe just read one instead of all 3. If you think the 30% quote is the most important, I'd list it first instead of last.
- A good exercise is to record your pitch and play it back for yourself. Try to figure out what you could take out.
